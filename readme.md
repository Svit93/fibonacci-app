### Run app

Open terminal in the root of the application a run this command:

```
npm run start
```

This should install all required dependencies, build both server and gui parts of the app and run them.

### Limitations

- The types are not used thoroughly in the app, especially in library & built-in functions, but custom functions and variables should be typed.
- There is a maximum value for the position input as the results of greater inputs are exceeding the max value of a number in javascript.
- the setup and dependencies might be a little mess and unnecessarily too big
